# E-commerceWebsite
This project deals with developing a Virtual website ‘E-commerce Website’ for selling and buying of vegetables online. It provides the user with a list of the various shops(here only 4 shops are included. More shops can be included by altering the code.) and different vegetables/fruits available for purchase in those shops. For the convenience of online shopping, a shopping cart is provided to the user. After the selection of the vegetables, it is sent for the order confirmation process. The system is implemented using Python's web framework Django.
